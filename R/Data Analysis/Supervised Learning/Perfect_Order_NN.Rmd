To Do
-----
* Use _neuralnet_
* Iterate on _maxit_ to try more epochs
* Iterate on sample size

Observations
------------
* Very simple structure developing
* Probably related to one variable being most important
* Do we need multiple layers to really get interaction effects?  Especially non-linear interaction effects?
* How does decay work?
* Why is the RFE chart showing up?

```{r packages, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load necessary packages 

#library(RWeka)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
#library(rpart)
library(nnet)
library(neuralnet)
#library(gbm)
```

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
# Clear workspace and set working directory
rm(list = ls())
setwd("/Users/kbrooks/Documents/CS7641 Machine Learning/Assignment 1")

d = readRDS("Perfect_Order_d.rds")
training = readRDS("Perfect_Order_training.rds")
testing = readRDS("Perfect_Order_testing.rds")

set.seed(250)
#summary(d)

```

Select and Tune Algorithm
-------------------------

We implemented neural networks using the _nnet_ package in R driven by the _caret_ machine learning framework. _Nnet_ fits a single-hidden layer neural network with the ability to utilize skip-layer connections[^fn-1]. For a single output with two levels represented by both data sets the model uses entropy fit. _Nnet_ is tuned using the following parameters:

* Decay rate of parameters (decay)
* Number of units in the hidden layer (size)

This tuning was accomplished using a 10-fold cross-validation repeated three times. In this process observations are split randomly into 10 groups. For each possible combination, a feature set is developed using data from 9 groups before being tested on the tenth “held out” group of observations. Due to the unbalanced classes we are using average Kappa instead of accuracy as the performance metric[^fn-2]. Average Kappa across folds and repetitions is then plotted for each combination of parameters and the best peforming combination selected[^fn-3]

[^fn-1]: Ripley, B. D. (1996) _Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks_. Cambridge.
[^fn-2]: $\kappa = \frac{O-E}{1-E}$
[^fn-3]: This approach is equivalent to plotting model complexity learning curve by combiing the results of the training and test sets through averaging across folds and repetitions.


```{r tuning, warning=FALSE}
#summary(training)

# for method = nnet
search.grid <- expand.grid(.decay = c(0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1), 
                           .size = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7))

# for method = neuralnet (regression)
# my.grid <- expand.grid(.layer1 = c(2 ,3, 4), .layer2 = c(2, 3, 4))

cvCtrl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", repeats = 3)

modelTune = train(Outcome ~ ., 
                  data = training, 
                  method = "nnet",
                  metric = "Kappa",
                  maxit = 100,
                  tuneGrid = search.grid,
                  trace = F,
                  trControl = cvCtrl,
                  preProcess = c("center", "scale"))

modelTune

saveRDS(modelTune, "Perfect_Order_NN_modelTune.rds")

modelTune$finalModel

plot(modelTune)

dev.copy(png,'NN_PO_Tuning.png')
dev.off()
```

Evaluate Algorithm on Test Set
------------------------------
Obtain and print confusion matrix and statistics

```{r predicting, warning=FALSE}
modelPred = predict(modelTune, testing)
confusionMatrix(modelPred, testing$Outcome)
#model.rmse = sqrt(mean((modelPred-testing$Species)^2))
```
